     <h3>Meet Frida</h3>
     <p>Mexican artist Frida Kahlo is remembered for her self-portraits, pain and passion, and bold, vibrant colors. She is celebrated in Mexico for her attention to Mexican and indigenous culture and by feminists for her depiction of the female experience and form.<br/> Life experience is a common theme in Kahloâ€™s approximately 200 paintings, sketches and drawings. Her physical and emotional pain are depicted starkly on canvases, as is her turbulent relationship with her husband, fellow artist Diego Rivera, who she married twice. Of her 143 paintings, 55 are self-portraits.</p>

        <p>After a day of classes, Kahlo and her friend boarded a bus and minutes after they sat down, the bus turned a corner and slammed into an electric trolley car traveling at full speed. She suffered serious internal injuries as a long metal rod tore through her midsection. They were so severe that she had to be encased in a full-body plaster cast.</p>
